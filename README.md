Thesis Data Analysis Scripts
Project Description
This repository contains the Python scripts used for the data analysis of flow cytometry results in breast cancer study on the investigation of anticancer activity of compound 7a against breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The scripts perform statistical analysis and generate visualizations to assess the efficacy of the treatment.

Repository Contents
MCF-7_complete_last_code.py: This script contains the analysis for the MCF-7 cell line, including data cleaning, statistical testing, and visualization.
MDA-MB-231_complete_last_code.py: This script is used for analyzing the MDA-MB-231 cell line data.
Prerequisites
To run these scripts, you need Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Statsmodels
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
Usage
To run these scripts, navigate to the directory containing the script files in your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python MCF-7_complete_last_code.py
Replace MCF-7_complete_last_code.py with MDA-MB-231_complete_last_code.py to run the analysis for the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
